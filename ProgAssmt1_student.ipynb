    "8. All code must be written by yourself. Copying from other students/material on the web is strictly prohibited. Any violations will result in zero marks. \n",

    "\n",
    "10. All plots must be labelled properly, all tables must have rows and columns named properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Plotting the data and prediction is highly encouraged for debugging. But remove debugging/understanding code before submitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Before subbmission ensure that you submit with the outputs (do not clear the outputs), so that when evaluating we can run selectively.\n",
